<h3>Hello! I'm Thomas and I'm an Agile-Minded Developer</h3>

<p>I'm a French developer, born in 2004, with a strong drive to build complete and engaging applications. My technical comfort zone lies in using <strong>Python</strong> to build robust backends and APIs, which I pair with modern frontend frameworks like <strong>Next.js and Vue.js</strong> to create dynamic user experiences. But beyond specific tools, I am a firm advocate for <strong>Scrum and Agile methodologies</strong>. I genuinely believe that the best software is built iteratively, prioritizing team collaboration, clear communication, and the flexibility to adapt to new challenges.</p>

<p>I put this mindset into practice with what I consider my biggest personal achievement: building a <strong>complete chess tournament simulator in Python</strong>. This was a significant undertaking that went far beyond a simple script. I designed it to manage player registration, automatically handle complex Swiss-system pairings round after round, track results in real-time, and generate final rankings. Seeing that project through from a simple idea to a fully functional application was a fantastic learning experience in managing complex logic.</p>

<p>Looking to the future, my ambition is to grow into a versatile <strong>full-stack developer</strong>. I'm not just looking for any role; I want to apply my skills to domains I'm personally passionate about, such as <strong>music, cinema, sports, and e-sports</strong>. I'm convinced that the best digital products come from teams who truly connect with the subject matter.</p>

<p>I'm self-aware about my areas for growth and am actively working to deepen my knowledge of <strong>database management</strong> to round out my backend skills, as well as exploring other ecosystems like <strong>C#</strong>. On a final note, I listen to a ton of music every day. This isn't just a fun fact; it means I have an intrinsic understanding of user-facing media apps, and I'm eager to bring that perspective to a team.</p>
